        <p>
            Dr. Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist and humanitarian who is
            considered to be one of the most important figures in the 20th century
            in the fight against hunger and famine, known for his development of
            high-yielding, disease-resistant wheat varieties that significantly
            increased global food production.

            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
                    University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as
                    the "National Youth Administration"
                </li>

                    Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
                    Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
                    scars on me."
                </li>
                <li>

                    Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
                    he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
                    breeding pest-resistent plants.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
                    Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
                    his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
                    disinfectants, and other applied science.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant

                    leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
                    plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
                    6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
                    different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
                    season, doubling wheat yields
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
                    with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
                    well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
                </li>

                    <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
                    strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
                    mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
                </li>
                <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
                    increase their maize and sorghum yields
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas
                    A&M University

                <li>
                    <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
                    food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the
                    only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
                    that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
                    genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
                    before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
                </li>
                <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
